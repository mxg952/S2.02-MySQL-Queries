# S2.02 - SQL Queries

This repository contains a set of SQL queries developed for educational purposes as part of the **S2.02 - SQL Queries** module.

## 📚 Goal

Learn to query and explore a relational database using **MySQL** with different levels of SQL statements, from basic `SELECT` to advanced `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `aggregations`.
